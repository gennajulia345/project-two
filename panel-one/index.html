        <h3>SZA</h3>
        <p>SOS is one the best albums I have listened to recently. A lot of people can agree when I say SZA has a beautiful voice. I never fully listened to all her music at once, and usually I listen to specific songs and not artists/albums. But when I played Low with my friends one time, I just knew I had to fully listen to this album and see the true hype that is Sza. Her lyrics are very relatable and powerful that they really stick with people. Like, there is a reason why they always go viral on tiktok. The beats she chooses and the melodies to her songs always make me feel something.</p>

      <h4>pinkpantheress</h4>
      <p>She is an upcoming indie hyperop artist and her songs last about 1-2 minutes but they always have the greatest beats and melodies. She also has lyrics that are so catchy and relatable when talking about love and emotions. I've been listening to her since 2020 so I feel like she'll be on my top spotify artists board every month until I stop listening to her. When I am walking around campus her music is perfect for that because it makes me feel like a main character in a coming of age film.</p>

      <h5>The Weeknd</h5>
      <p>Abel. (That's his real name) He can do it all. I grew up listening to his music and as I get older it just keeps getting better. Every hit song on the radio since the 2010s has been done by him and there is something about his voice that always gets me. The Weeknd is not an artist I specifically listen to on my own, but with the release of his most recent album Dawn FM, I couldn't help BUT listen to it. It feels like I am transported to an 80s futuristic movie.</p>
